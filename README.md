<h2>Professional Self-Assessment </h2>
Completing my coursework in the Computer Science program and building this ePortfolio has been both a challenging and rewarding experience that has shaped my professional goals and strengthened my technical expertise. It has prepared me to enter the field with confidents. The projects I completed throughout the program allowed me to explore a wide range of technical domains, from embedded systems and mobile app development to database management and secure coding practices.  I have built a strong foundation not only in technical skills but also in critical areas such as problem-solving, collaboration, communication, and professional responsibility. 

While most of my projects were individually owned rather than team-based, the experience still prepared me for collaborative environments. I learned to structure work so it scales to a team: breaking features into small milestones, maintaining a clean Git history with branches and descriptive commit messages, writing design notes and READMEs, and keeping interfaces and modules well-documented and testable. I practiced “communication by artifacts” or clear code comments, diagrams, and checklists so another developer could pick up my work quickly. I also incorporated instructor feedback and occasional asynchronous peer critique, which mirrors how distributed teams collaborate without constant real-time meetings. 

In addition to collaboration, I learned how to effectively communicate with stakeholders; both technical and non-technical. Throughout the program, I practiced presenting technical solutions in a way that was accessible to broader audiences. For instance, in my mobile app project, I not only implemented secure data handling and notification features but also considered how end users would interact with the app, ensuring usability and clarity. This balance between technical precision and user-focused communication is something I will carry forward into my career. 

My coursework also gave me a strong command of data structures and algorithms, which I consistently applied to solve real-world problems. Whether optimizing database queries, managing prerequisite chains in a course planner, or tracking trends in a weight-monitoring app, I learned how to choose appropriate structures like arrays, hash maps, and trees to improve efficiency. These skills make sure that I can design software that is both performant and scalable. 

In terms of software engineering and databases, I gained hands-on experience in building secure, maintainable systems from the ground up. I developed applications that connected front-end interfaces to back-end logic, integrated multithreading for responsiveness, and implemented secure coding standards such as parameterized queries and input validation. These experiences have prepared me to deliver production-ready solutions that adhere to best practices in modern software development. 

Security has been another major theme of my growth. From early coursework in secure coding standards to implementing authentication and safe data handling in my Android app, I have consistently emphasized protecting user data and system integrity. Understanding principles such as encryption, secure database access, and responsible resource management ensures that I can contribute to building systems that users and organizations can trust. 

The artifacts included in this portfolio collectively demonstrate the breadth of my skills. My thermostat-to-piano project showcases embedded systems design, concurrency, and hardware-software integration. My mobile weight-tracking app highlights my proficiency with algorithms, data structures, Android development, and secure coding. Finally, my course planner database project demonstrates my ability to design efficient data models, implement recursive algorithms, and manage memory responsibly. Together, these projects illustrate my ability to design, implement, and refine solutions across diverse platforms and problem domains. 

As I reflect on my journey, I see how each project built on the last to develop me into a well-rounded computer scientist. This ePortfolio represents not only my technical accomplishments but also my growth as a professional who values clean code, security, usability, and collaboration. Moving forward, I am excited to apply these skills in industry, contribute to innovative projects, and continue learning as technology evolves.
